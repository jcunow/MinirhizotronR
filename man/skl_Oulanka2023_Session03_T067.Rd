\description{
The image is derived from a rgb root scan after using "RootDetector" to segment and skeletonize.
Roots are represented as = 1, Background = 0.
The first layer also shows foreign objects such as tape as = 1.
The scan originates from a sedge fen in northern Finland in early June.
Columns correspond to tube length and rows to tube rotation
