\title{Estimate Translation Between Overlap Regions}
\usage{
estimate_translation(prev_region, curr_region, method = "crosscorr")
}
\arguments{
\item{prev_region}{A cimg object representing the overlap region from the previous image.}

\item{curr_region}{A cimg object representing the overlap region from the current image.}

\item{method}{A string specifying the method for estimating translation. One of "crosscorr" or "phasecorr". Default is "crosscorr".}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length two containing the translation offsets (dx, dy).
}
\description{
