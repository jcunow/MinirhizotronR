\title{Find Modal Peaks in a Density Estimation}
\usage{
modal_peaks(x, prominence_threshold = 0.005, display_type = "density")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of data for which the modal peaks are to be identified.}

\item{prominence_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the minimum prominence of peaks to be considered.
If `NULL`, no prominence threshold is applied. Default is 0.005.}

\item{display_type}{A character string indicating the type of output display. Options are:
- `"density"` for a density plot with peaks and valleys marked (default),
- `"raw"` for a raw line plot with peaks and valleys marked,
- `"none"` for no plot, just returning the peak and valley data.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
        - `peak_x`: The x-coordinates of the detected peaks.
        - `peak_y`: The y-coordinates (density values) of the detected peaks.
        - `valley_x`: The x-coordinates of the detected valleys (or NULL if none).
        - `valley_y`: The y-coordinates (density values) of the detected valleys (or NULL if none).
        - `prominences`: The prominence of each peak (or NULL if none).
        - A message indicating the number of modes in the distribution.
}
\description{
This function identifies peaks and valleys in the density estimation of the input data.
It computes the prominence of each peak and allows the user to filter peaks based on a prominence threshold.
The function also provides the option to visualize the data as either a density plot, a raw line plot, or no display.

\examples{
# Simulate a bimodal distribution
set.seed(123)
x <- c(rnorm(500, mean = -2, sd = 1), rnorm(500, mean = 3, sd = 1))

# Call the function with density plot (default)
results_density <- modal_peaks(x, prominence_threshold = 0.005, display_type = "density")

# Call the function with raw line plot
results_raw <- modal_peaks(x, prominence_threshold = 0.005, display_type = "raw")

# Call the function with no display (just returns results)
results_none <- modal_peaks(x, prominence_threshold = 0.005, display_type = "none")
