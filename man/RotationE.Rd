\title{Estimates Rotation from Tape Coverage. Assumes that more tape is present on the tube upside.}
\usage{
RotationE(
  img,
  tape.brightness = 0.66,
  extra.rows = 100,
  search.area = 0.45,
  tape.quantile = 0.98,
  nclasses = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{takes raster, file name, or array input.}

\item{tape.brightness}{used for clustering. Silver Dukt tape appears bright e.g., > 0.66.}

\item{extra.rows}{In case no tape is present. Best leave unchanged - some extra.rows are recommended and will be subtracted from the output anyway.}

\item{search.area}{portion of image to perform the tape search on. Potential speed increase.}

\item{tape.quantile}{aligns extra.rows brightness with tape to ensure the same cluster class. The default uses Silver Tape as reference.}

\item{nclasses}{number of classes to group pixels with unsupervised Clustering from the RStoolbox package. Leave at default unless weird results are being displayed.}
}
\value{
numeric value corresponding to the center of extruding tape
